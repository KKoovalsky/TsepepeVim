*tsepepe.txt*	Tiny plugin for humble C++ refactoring.

Allows to generate function definitions only, for now, but more features
are going to be implemented. ;)

Requires compilation database (compile_commands.json) to be held under the root 
directory of the project.

Commands:
:TsepepeGenDef
	Generates function definition in a corresponding source file from
        a function declared at line under cursor. It is assumend that the name
        of the corresponding source file has format: 
            <stem of the currently active file (a header file is supposed>.cpp
        The corresponding *.cpp file is tried to be found recursively,
        starting from the project root directory, which is assumed to be where
        the compilation database is located.
        After the command is executed, the corresponding *.cpp file is
        activated in a buffer.
        The generated definition will be appended at the end of the file.

						*tsepepe-settings*
This plugin doesn't have any settings.
